h1. RedPoints

RedPoints is a Ruby library that allows the plotting of trajectories on an OpenGL view.

It is designed to run as a separate process, to which you connect via DRb within your application/command/utility/whatsoever.

At the moment, it only plots an array of coordinates as a sequence of straight segments. I'm planning to add support for drawing more complex objects.
