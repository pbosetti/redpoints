h1. RedPoints

RedPoints is a Ruby library that allows the plotting of trajectories on an OpenGL view.

It is designed to run as a separate process, to which you connect via DRb within your application/command/utility/whatsoever.

At the moment, it only plots an array of coordinates as a sequence of straight segments. I'm planning to add support for drawing more complex objects.

Here's the obligatory screenshot, taken from the parent "GtoPDL2 project":http://github.com/pbosetti/gtopdl2:

h2. Run a basic test

First, launch the viewer:

<code>$> ruby lib/redpoints.rb &</code>

Then run the test:

<code>$> ruby client_test.rb</code>

The communication between the client and the viewer exploits the great DRb library (Distributed Ruby) through the TCP port 9000.
At the end, close the viewer by hitting ESC.
